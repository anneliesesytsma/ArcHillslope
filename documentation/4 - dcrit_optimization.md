## Rational method optimization tool

This tool performs a numerical optimization by calculating the values of *A(D)*, *Q(D)*, and *C(D)=Q/AI* for a range of storm durations using the analytical solutions for user-defined IFD constants *K* and *b*. The user may either provide a value for *k_s* or a value for *C*. If a *k_s* value is provided, analytical solutions calculate curves for *A(D)*, *Q(D)*, and *C(D)*. If a *C* value is provided, analytical solutions proceed with *k_s=0* and calculate curves for *A(D)* only. In this case, *Q(D) = CAI*, where *C* is given, *I* is from the IFD curve, and *A*  is calculated from analytical solutions. Otherwise, *Q* can be calculated directly from analytical solutions.


The tool saves the following outputs from this step: *Q_{max}* (*m^3/s*),*D_{crit}* (*s*), *t_c* (*s*), and *D_{crit}*/*t_c*. The output *Q_{max}* represents the the maximum value of *Q(D)*. The output *D_{crit}* identifies the duration for which *Q(D)=Q_{max}*. The output *t_c* corresponds to the first storm duration for which the entire hillslope contributes flow to the outlet. The final output, *D_{crit}*/*t_c*, is produced to assist with interpretation of results. If  *D_{crit}*/*t_c* *\approx{1}*, then the Rational Method may provide an adequate approximation to maximum peak flow on the landscape. However, if *D_{crit}*/*t_c* < 1, then the Rational Method and *t_c* are likely to result in underestimation of *Q_{max}*. In addition to these four main outputs, this step also includes an option to produce a normalized hydrograph for a chosen hillslope using the critical storm defined by *D_{crit}* and *I(D_{crit})* .
